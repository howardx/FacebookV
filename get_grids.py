input parameters for def get_grids():
- filename - input filename with path (probably the training set)

- outputPath - only used if the 3rd parameter is set to True, will be the path to store NxN files, 
               each file contains a grid of data points
               
- outputFile - boolean that tells whether you want NxN files as output or a dict of pd.DataFrame
               as output, format would be (x_idx, y_idx) : df_for_grid. If you want file as output
               then x_idx, y_idx will appear in output files' name
               
- n - NxM grid, the N value, for x axis

- m - NxM grid, the M value, for y axis

- x - column name of the x coordinate in input file

- y - column name of the y coordinate in input file
